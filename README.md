# Task-Scheduler-V2

## Overview

Task Scheduler is a standalone project for me to get a better handling on Google OAuth and Calendar APIs while also using OpenAI Chat API


## Features

  Retrieves and processes user calendar data (e.g., Google Calendar) to identify available time slots.

  Computes free periods and automatically proposes slots for tasks, ensuring efficient time management.

- **LLM Enhanced Interactions:**  
  Uses an LLM to understand natural language instructions and generate human-friendly suggestions for scheduling tasks.

  Easily switches between testing and production configurations using environment variables.

- **Testing and Coverage:**  
  Includes comprehensive tests using `pytest` along with coverage reporting.
